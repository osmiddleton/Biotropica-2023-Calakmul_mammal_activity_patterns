**Cristina Argudin-Violante, Owen Middleton, Kathy Slater,Esteban Dominguez-Bonilla & Patrick Doncaster (2023) Neo-tropical felid activity patterns in relation to potential prey and intra-guild competitors in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Biotropica.                                                                   #

The analyses investigated the extent of overlap in the activity patterns between the three largest felids in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (jaguars, pumas, and ocelots) with potential prey species (collared peccary, brocket deer, white-tailed deer, Baird's tapir, coati, paca, agouti, common opossum, ocellated turkey andcreat currasow). 

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve is on the edge of a vast area of connected forest throughout Central America that is thought to be a stronghold for large mammals of conservation concern in the area. As such, it faces heavy pressure from human activity, with urban development encoraching on the area and also hunting pressures. Despite this, it remains relatively understudied, and this study is the first in the area to investigate mammalian activity patterns. Furthermore, this study is novel across the Americas through the comparison of three neo-tropical felids that have the potential to compete for resources, with the focus of most studies being on the largest felids or smaller felids.
